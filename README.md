# tictactoe
A tic tac toe game built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

2 players


To Play:

Player one clicks on a square to make a move.

Once a square is clicked, it will be marked with either an 'X' for player one or an 'O' for player two, and control will be switched to the next player.
Note: Once a move is made, there is no way to undo that move

Players will take turns making moves until one player has 3 in a row, or until it is impossible for either player to get 3 in a row.
