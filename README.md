# tictactoe
A tic tac toe game built using HTML/CSS/JavaScript

2 players


#To Play:

Player one clicks on a square to make a move.

Once a square is clicked, it will be marked with either an 'X' for player one or an 'O' for player two, and control will be given to the next player.

Players will take turns making moves until one player has 3 in a row, or until it is impossible for either player to get 3 in a row.


#Extras:
Players have the option to go back in time to past moves.  These moves will be displayed on the side.

Clicking on a past move resets the board to that instance.  Any moves made after this will override previously saved moves from that point onward. (Like clicking back on your browser and going to a new page)
